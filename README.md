<div align="center">
  <ul>
    <li>The use cases and operation of the system</li>
    <li>The maintenance of the system</li>
    <li>The developement of the system</li>

<p align="center">element of the system while making the details irrelevent to that policy. This allows decisions about those details to be</p>
<p align="center">delayed and deferred</p>
